# Loan Default Prediction Using Feature Engineering

## Overview
Finding a suitable place to live is a crucial decision, significantly impacting your well-being. While online listings provide information, it can be challenging to assess a property's true "habitability" based solely on descriptions. This is where AI can lend a helping hand!

This project is part of the **ML Olympiad - Sustainable Urban Living** competition, where participants leverage Machine Learning techniques to develop a model that predicts the habitability score of a property based on available details. The model aims to contribute to a user-friendly system that empowers individuals to make informed decisions about their living spaces.

### Goal
Develop a machine learning model that predicts the Sustainable Habitability Score of a property based on the provided data.

### Dataset
The dataset contains various properties from across the United States. Your challenge is to predict the "habitability score" for each property, considering multiple factors that contribute to a comfortable and enjoyable living experience.
- you can find test data set [here](test.csv) and train data set [here](train.csv)

### Explainability
Explainability is crucial! Strive to build models that not only predict accurately but also provide understandable insights into the factors influencing habitability scores. This will help users interpret the results and make informed decisions.

### Evaluation
The model's performance is evaluated based on its ability to accurately predict habitability scores. The primary metric for evaluation is the **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**.
